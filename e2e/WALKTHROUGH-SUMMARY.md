## Key Discoveries & Fixes

### 🔧 Critical Issue Fixed: Parent Authentication
**Problem Identified**:
- Parent login form existed but didn't set authentication state
- Users remained on login page after clicking "Sign In"
- Dashboard was unreachable due to route protection

**Solution Implemented**:
```typescript
// Added proper parent authentication handler
const handleParentLogin = async () => {
  if (parentEmail && parentPassword) {
    // Create authenticated parent profile
    const parentProfile = { /* StudentModel for parent */ };

    // Set authentication state and navigate
    dispatch(setStudent(parentProfile));
    navigate('/parent-dashboard');
  }
};
```

**Technical Changes**:
1. ✅ Added parent login state management in `LoginPage.tsx`
2. ✅ Implemented `handleParentLogin` function with Redux dispatch
