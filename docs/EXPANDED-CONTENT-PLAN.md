  description: string;
  pointMultiplier: number;
  timeLimit?: number;
  hintsAllowed: number;
}
```

**Level Progression:**

  calculateNewDifficulty(current: number, performance: number): number {
    const K = 32; // Sensitivity factor
    const expected = 1 / (1 + Math.pow(10, (current - performance) / 400));
    const actual = performance > 0.7 ? 1 : 0;
    return current + K * (actual - expected);
  }

  // Zone of Proximal Development maintenance
  getOptimalChallenge(ability: number): number {
    return ability + 0.5; // Slightly above current ability
  }
}
```
